Bot Battlr - React App

Overview

Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! This React application allows you to browse through a list of robots, view their details, and enlist them into your army.

Core Deliverables

Display a collection of bots, showing their name, health, damage, armor, and class.
Clicking on a bot card should display detailed information about that bot.

Advanced Deliverables

Enlist Bots: Users can choose to enlist a bot into their army or just view their data. Clicking on a bot card should display a show view (BotSpecs) for that bot, with buttons to go back to the list view or enlist the bot.
Sort Bots: Bots can be sorted by their health, damage, or armor using a SortBar component.
Remove Bot from Collection: When a bot is enlisted, it should be removed from the BotCollection and added to YourBotArmy.
Filter Bots by Class: Users can filter bots by their class, selecting multiple filters at the same time.
Enlist One Bot per Class: Users can only enlist one bot from each bot_class (e.g., "Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch").
